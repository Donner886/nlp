Never trust HSBC apps.,1,GooglePlay,11-Jun-17,HK Bank,en
HSBC HK,DON'T install this app and don't give up your security. This app is a joke. It screwed up my log on and there was no way to revert back to the security device unless you cancel the internet banking altogether and reappy for it. I was not able to access my HSBC accounts for months. You then have to set up all the registered accounts associated with your accounts,1,GooglePlay,13-Dec-17,HK Bank,en
PayMe,"Under iOS version 11.3 with the latest version of PayMe app, cannot take photo for identity card upload even I have clicked the take photo icon, it redirect to the guideline page, no action can be performed and have to force close the app.

HSBC HK,I hate this because it practically disabled my ability to handle my finances over the web/on my phone. It often loops when I tried to use it for various kinds of authentication. Transfers done through the app seem to not get through and require more reviews than normal ones. Authentication using this app for transfers through the HSBC website caused website to error out with a multi-session logged in warning.,1,AppStore,25/06/2017 06:42,HK Bank,en

HSBC HK,I recently update my phone to Android 10. This app fail to recognize both my fingerprints and the Mobile Security Key Password. I cannot logon on this app anymore.

HSBC HK,"The app is very poorly designed. It is slow and options are hard to find. On top of it, it stops working on some days. Password reset process is opaque. The one time passwords they send do not work and you can end up locking your account.

The flow of UI is completely not user-friendly at all. Who will open a full version portal in a browser THROUGH AN APP?

Also, it is a common sense to show information of all accounts simultaneously without openning any sub-menu.
